# Interactive Machine Learning Frontend

## About

An web application which allows for interaction with various machine learning models as implemented in [interactive-ml-backend](https://github.com/UAFederez/interactive-ml-backend). This allows users to experiment with modifying various parameters about machine learning models and visualize the progression of the training phase.

Currently, while many of the pages already have the content explaining the mathematical derivation and the explanation behind the implementation, the following pages have interactivity on the dataset as well as the machine learning model:

-   Univariate Linear Regression
-   Multivariate Linear Regression
