        Decision trees represent another supervised learning algorithm that can
        be used for both classification and regression tasks. The algorithm is
        designed to make a decision about a class label or a value based on a
        sequence of <em>decisions</em> or questions that evaluate to branches in
        a structure akin to a tree.
