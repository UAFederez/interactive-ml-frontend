            The fundamental building block of neural networks are{" "}
            <em>neurons</em> or layers of neurons which allow for deep-layer
            architectures to learn complex functions associated with more
            complex data. A neuron is essentially a unit which computes and
            learns the optimal parameters for an <em>activation function</em> in
            such a way so as to minimize the total loss of the network as a
            whole given the dataset. This demonstrates an application of simple
            feedforward neural networks.
